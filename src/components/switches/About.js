            In pursuit of my ongoing curiosity for language, concepts, and space, I became a developer. It began in late 2019 when
            I realized programming was how we talk to computers, another form of communication.
            </p>
            <p className="about__blurb">
              Enthralled by this idea, I began to program using acccessible resources before deciding to jump ship. 
              I was cautious to start something new since I had already tried a few different things, but I was so curious
              about learning another language, albeit one for computers, the transition felt natural.

              Before, I struggled to find something that could marry what I was with what I wanted to be. 
              I felt at home in creative spaces, but I wasnâ€™t an artist. 
              I was a writer, but left unsatiated by words. 
              I valued reason and logical thinking, but felt limited by an absent stem degree. 
            </p>   
            <p className="about__blurb">
              Through coding, I am able to realize my interests in an arena that doubles for both play and work. I am grateful to have found
              it and look forward to what lay ahead.
